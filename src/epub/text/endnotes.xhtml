					<p>Cicero, in a well-known passage of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Ethics</i>, speaks of trade as irredeemably base, if petty; but as not so absolutely felonious, if wholesale. He gives a <em>real</em> merchant (one who is such in the English sense) leave to think himself a shade above small beer. <a href="../text/the-affliction-of-childhood.xhtml#note-1" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>"The astonishment of science" — Her medical attendants were Dr. Percival, a well-known literary physician, who had been a correspondent of Condorcet, D'Alembert, etc., and Mr. Charles White, a very distinguished surgeon. It was he who pronounced her head to be the finest in its structure and development of any that he had ever seen, — an assertion which, to my own knowledge, he repeated in after years, and with enthusiasm. That he had some acquaintance with the subject may be presumed from this, that he wrote and published a work on the human skull, supported by many measurements which he had made of heads selected from all varieties of the human species. Meantime, as I would be loath that any trait of what might seem vanity should creep into this record, I will candidly admit that she died of hydrocephalus; and it has been often supposed that the premature expansion of the intellect in cases of that class is altogether morbid, — forced on, in fact, by the mere stimulation of the disease. I would, however, suggest, as a possibility, the very inverse order of relation between the disease and the intellectual manifestations. Not the disease may always have caused the preternatural growth of the intellect; but, on the contrary, this growth coming on spontaneously, and outrunning the capacities of the physical structure, may have caused the disease. <a href="../text/the-affliction-of-childhood.xhtml#note-2" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>Amongst the oversights in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Paradise Lost</i>, some of which hare not yet been perceived, it is certainly <em>one</em>— that, by placing in such overpowering light of pathos the sublime sacrifice of Adam to his love for his frail companion, he has too much lowered the guilt of his disobedience to God. All that Milton can say afterwards does not, and cannot, obscure the beauty of that action; reviewing it calmly, we condemn, but taking the impassioned station of Adam at the moment of temptation, we approve in our hearts. This was certainly an oversight; but it was one very difficult to redress. I remember, amongst the many exquisite thoughts of John Paul (Richten), one which strikes me as particularly touching, upon this subject. He suggests, not as any grave theological comment, but as the wandering fancy of a poetic heart, that, had Adam conquered the anguish of separation as a pure sacrifice of obedience to God, his reward would have been the pardon and reconciliation of Eve, together with her restoration to innocence. <a href="../text/the-affliction-of-childhood.xhtml#note-3" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>"I felt"— The reader must not forget, in reading this and other passages, that, though a child's feelings are spoken of, it is not the child who speaks. <em>I</em> decipher what the child only felt in cipher. And so far is this distinction or this explanation from pointing to anything metaphysical or doubtful that a man must be grossly unobservant who is not aware of what I am here noticing, not as a peculiarity of this child or that, but as a necessity of all children. Whatsoever in a man's mind blossoms and expands to his own consciousness in mature life, must have preexisted in germ during his infancy. I, for instance, did not, as a child, <em>consciously</em> read in my own deep feelings these ideas. No, not at all; nor was it possible for a child to do so. I, the child, had the feelings; I, the man, decipher them. In the child lay the handwriting mysterious to <em>him</em>; in me, the interpretation and the comment. <a href="../text/the-affliction-of-childhood.xhtml#note-9" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>I except, however, one case, — the case of a child dying of an organic disorder, so, therefore, as to die slowly, and aware of its own condition. Because such a child is solemnized, and sometimes, in a partial sense, inspired, — inspired by the depth of its sufferings, and by the awfulness of its prospect. Such a child, having put off the earthly mind in many things, may naturally have put off the childissh mind in all things. I thereby, speaking for myself only, acknowledge to have read with emotion a record of a little girl, who, knowing herself for months to be amongst the elect of death, became anxious, even to sickness of heart, for what she called the "conversion" of her father. Her filial duty and reverence had been swallowed up in filial love. <a href="../text/the-affliction-of-childhood.xhtml#note-10" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>"African Obeah." — Thirty years ago it would not have been necessary to say one word of the Obi or Obeah magic; because at that time several distinguished writers (Miss Edgeworth, for instance, in her Belinda) had made use of this superstition in fictions, and because the remarkable history of Three-fingered Jack, a story brought upon the stage, had made the superstition notorious as a fact. Now, however, so long after the case has probably passed out of the public mind, it may be proper to mention, that when an Obeah man — that is, a professor of this dark collusion with human fears and human credulity— had once woven his dreadful net of ghostly terrors, and had thrown it over his selected victim, vainly did that victim flutter, struggle, languish in the meshes, unless the spells were reversed, he generally perished; and with out a wound, except from his own too domineering fancy. <a href="../text/the-affliction-of-childhood.xhtml#note-13" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>What follows, I think (for book I have none of any kind where his paper is proceeding), namely: <i xml:lang="la">et sera sub nocte rudentum</i>, is probably a mistake of Virgil's; the lions did not roar because night was approaching, but because night brought with it their principal meal, and consequently the impatience of hunger.  <a href="../text/the-affliction-of-childhood.xhtml#note-14" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>In this place I derive my feeling partly from a lovely sketch of the appearance, in verse, by Mr. Wordsworth; partly from my own experience of the case; and, not having the poems here I know not how to proportion my acknowledgments.  <a href="../text/the-affliction-of-childhood.xhtml#note-16" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>"And so, then," the cynic objects, "you rank your own mind (and you tell us so frankly) amongst the primary formations?" As I love to annoy him, it would give me pleasure to reply — "Perhaps I do." But as I never answer more questions than are necessary, I confine myself to saying, that this is not a necessary construction of the words. Some minds stand nearer to the type of the original nature in man, are truer than others to the great magnet in our dark planet. Minds that are impassioned on a more colossal scale than ordinary, deeper in their vibrations, and more extensive in the scale of their vibrations, whether, in other parts of their intellectual system, they had or had not a corresponding compass, will tremble to greater depths from a fearful convulsion, and will come round by a longer curve of undulations. <a href="../text/the-affliction-of-childhood.xhtml#note-17" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>
